## Overview

A Gallery layout makes all of the children a uniform size, the children are displayed horizontally, and they wrap as needed.

## Usage

| Class | Applied To | Outcome |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `.pf-l-gallery` |  `<div>` |  Initializes a Gallery layout |
| `.pf-l-gallery__item` | `<div>` |  Explicitly sets the child for the gallery. This class isn't necessary, but it is included to keep inline with BEM convention, and to provide an entity that will later be used for applying modifiers. |
| `.pf-has-gutter` | `.pf-l-gallery` | Adds space between children |
