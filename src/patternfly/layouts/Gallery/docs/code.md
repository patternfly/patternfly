## Overview

A Gallery layout makes all of the children a uniform size, the children are displayed horizontally, and they wrap as needed. It's really just a grid, but the name is already taken.

## Usage

| Class | Usage |
| -- | -- |
| `.pf-l-gallery` |  **Outcome:** Initializes a Gallery layout | **Required:** Yes |
| `.pf-l-gallery__item` |  **Outcome:** Explicitly sets the child for the gallery | **Required:** No | **Remarks:** This class isn't necessary, but it is included to keep inline with BEM convention, and to provide an entity that will later be used for applying modifiers.
