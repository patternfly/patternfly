## Overview

A level is a layout that distributes the space between children evenly and it centers children on the x-axis. By default it positions the children horizontally, but on smaller devices it will position the children vertically.

## Usage

| Class | Usage |
| -- | -- |
| `.pf-l-level` |  **Outcome:** Initializes the level layout **Required:** Yes |
| `.pf-l-level__item` |  **Outcome:** Explicitly sets a child of the level | **Required:** No | **Remarks:** This class isn't necessary, but it is included to keep inline with BEM convention, and to provide an entity that will later be used for applying modifiers.
| `.pf-has-gutter` |  **Outcome:** Adds space between children | **Required:** No
