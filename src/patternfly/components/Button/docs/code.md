## Overview

Always add a modifier class to add color to the button.

## Button vs Link
Semantic buttons and links are important for usability as well as accessibility. Using an `a` instead of a `button` element to perform user initiated actions should be avoided, unless absolutely necessary.

## Accessibility

| Attribute | Applied To | Outcome |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `aria-pressed="true or false"` | `.pf-c-button` | Indicates that the button is a toggle. When set to "true", `pf-m-active` should also be set so that the button displays in an active state. **Required when button is a toggle** |
| `aria-label="[button label text]"` | `.pf-m-plain` | Provides an accessible name for the button when an icon is used instead of text. **Required when icon is used with no supporting text** |
| `aria-label="[link description]"` | `a.pf-c-button` | The link text should adequately describe the link's purpose. If it does not, aria-label can provide more detailed interaction information. |
| `disabled` | `button.pf-c-button` | When a button element is used, indicates that it is unavailable and removes it from keyboard focus. **Required when button is disabled** |
| `aria-disabled="true"` | `a.pf-c-button` | When a link element is used, indicates that it is unavailable. **Required when link is disabled** |
| `tabindex="-1"` | `a.pf-c-button` | When a link element is used, removes it from keyboard focus. **Required when link is disabled** |

## Usage

| Class | Applied To | Outcome |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `.pf-c-button` | `<button>` |  Initiates a button. Always use it with a modifier class. **Required** |
| `.pf-c-button__icon` | `*` |  Applies styles to icons in a button. For use when there is an icon followed by text. |
| `.pf-m-primary` | `.pf-c-button` | Modifies for primary styles. |
| `.pf-m-secondary` | `.pf-c-button` | Modifies for secondary styles. |
| `.pf-m-tertiary` | `.pf-c-button` | Modifies for tertiary styles. |
| `.pf-m-danger` | `.pf-c-button` | Modifies for danger styles. |
| `.pf-m-link` | `.pf-c-button` | Modifies for link styles. This button has no background or border and is styled as a link. This button would commonly appear in a form and may include an icon. |
| `.pf-m-plain` | `.pf-c-button` | Modifies for icon styles. This button has no background or border, uses a standard text color, and is used for `.pf-m-plain` icon buttons such as close, expand, kebab, etc. |
| `.pf-m-block` | `.pf-c-button` | Creates a block level button. |
| `.pf-m-hover` | `.pf-c-button` | Forces display of the hover state of the button. This state is primarily for demonstration purposes and would not normally be used in lieu of the `:hover` pseudo-class.  |
| `.pf-m-active` | `.pf-c-button` | Forces display of the active state of the button. This state is primarily for demonstration purposes and would not normally be used in lieu of the `:active` pseudo-class.  |
| `.pf-m-focus` | `.pf-c-button` | Forces display of the focus state of the button. This state is primarily for demonstration purposes and would not normally be used in lieu of the `:focus` pseudo-class.  |
