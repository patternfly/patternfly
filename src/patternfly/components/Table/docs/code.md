## Overview

Because the table component is not used for layout and presents tabular data only, it requires the use of `role="grid"`. Expandable table content (`.pf-c-table__expandable-content`) is placed within a singular `<td>` per expandable row, that can span multiple columns.

## Role="grid"

Applying `role="grid"` to tables enhances accessible interaction while in table layout, however the responsive, css grid based layout can cause unexpected interactions. Therefore, for css grid layout, it is recommended that `role="grid"` be removed.

## Sortable Tables

Table columns may shift when expanding/collapsing. To address this, set `.pf-m-fit-content`, or assign a width `.pf-m-width-[width]` to the corresponding `<th>` defining the column or `<td>` within the column. Width values are `[10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]` or `max`.

## Table Header Cells
By default, all table header cells are set to `white-space: nowrap`. If a `<th>`'s content needs to wrap, apply `.pf-m-wrap`.

## Implementation Support
- One expandable toggle button, positioned in the first cell of a non-expandable row, preceding an expandable row.
- One checkbox, positioned in the first or second cell of a non-expandable row.
- One action button, positioned in the last cell of a non-expandable row.
- Tabular data.
- Compact presentation modifier (not compatible with expandable table).

## Responsive layout modifiers

| Class | Applied To | Outcome |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `.pf-m-grid-md`, `.pf-m-grid-lg`, `.pf-m-grid-xl` | `.pf-c-table` | Changes tabular layout to responsive, grid based layout at suffixed breakpoint. |
| `.pf-m-grid` | `.pf-c-table` | Changes tabular layout to responsive, grid based layout. This approach requires JavaScript to set this class at some prescribed viewport width value. |

## Extra modifiers

| Class | Applied To | Outcome |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `.pf-m-wrap` | `<th>`, `<td>` | Modifies content to wrap. |
