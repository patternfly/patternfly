## Overview

Skip to content allows screen reader and keyboard users to bypass navigation rather than tabbing through it.

When using `.pf-c-skip-to-content` you must provide an `href` attribute whose value corresponds to the `id` attribute of the primary content container for your application. In most cases this is the `<main>` element. For a demo of this see the [page demo](../../../demos/Page/examples), and note the use of `tabindex="-1"` which allows the element to receive focus programmatically.

## Accessibility

| Attribute | Applied to | Outcome |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `href="[id of main container]"` | `.pf-c-skip-to-content` | Sends focus to the primary content container. **Required** |

## Usage

| Class | Applied to | Outcome |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `.pf-c-skip-to-content` | `<a>` |  initiates the skip to content link. |
| `.pf-m-focus` | `.pf-c-skip-to-content` |  Forces display of the focus state. This state is primarily for demonstration purposes and would not normally be used in lieu of the `:focus` pseudo-class. |
