## Overview

Skip to content allows screen reader and keyboard users to bypass navigation rather than tabbing through it.

When using `.pf-c-skip-to-content` you must also provide an anchor with the matching id that is applied to the `href` attribute of `.pf-c-skip-to-content`. You will typically place this just before the main content of the page. Ex: `<a id="main-content" name="main-content"></a>` For a demo of this see the <a href="/demos/Page/examples">Page demo</a>.

## Usage
