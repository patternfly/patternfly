## Overview

A Switch is an alternative to the checkbox component.

Use a switch when your user needs to perform instantaneous actions without confirmation.

Use checkbox if your user has to perform additional steps for changes to become effective.

## Accessibility

| Attribute | Applied To | Outcome |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `aria-labelledby="..."` or `aria-label="..."` | `.pf-c-switch__input` | Indicates the action triggered by the switch. If an additional text label is included with the switch besides `.pf-c-switch__label.pf-m-on`, then `aria-labelledby` can reference the `id` of this text, or this text can be used as the value for `aria-label`. If the text included for `.pf-c-switch__label.pf-m-on` provides additional meaning to the primary label that's referenced, then it can also be represented as part of the `aria-labelledby` or `aria-label` attribute.Â **Required** |
| `for` | `<label>` | Each `<label>` must have a `for` attribute that matches its input id. **Required** |
| `id` | `<input type="checkbox">` | Each `<input>` must have an `id` attribute that matches its label's `for` value. **Required** |
| `id` | `.pf-c-switch__label` | Each `.pf-c-switch__label` must have an `id` attribute that matches the `aria-labelledby` on `.pf-c-switch__input`. |
| `checked` | `.pf-c-switch__input` |  Indicates that the input is checked |
| `disabled` | `.pf-c-switch__input` |  Indicates that the input is disabled |
| `aria-hidden="true"` | `.pf-c-switch__label` | Hides the text from the screen reader. |
