The Dropdown Select should be used when the user is selecting an option from a list of items. Although the presentation is similar to the basic dropdown, the underlying HTML and Aria tag structure is specific to a select list.

*Note:* The attribute `aria-pressed="true"` should be set programmatically to the active item.
