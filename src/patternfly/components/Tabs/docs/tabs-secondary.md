### Note

Secondary tabs can be placed as an independent component anywhere within an interface. If placed directly adjacent to a set of primary tabs, they adopt a small amount of styling to properly align the two tab sets.

If secondary tabs cannot be placed directly adjacent to primary tabs, `.pf-m-tabs-secondary` can be applied to a directly adjacent container `<div>` with `.pf-c-tabs` as a child to achieve the same effect.
