## Overview

A box is a generic rectangular container that can be used to build other components (e.g. cards).

## Usage

| Class | Applied | Outcome |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `.pf-c-box` | `<div>` | Creates a box containing content |
| `.pf-is-fullbleed` | `.pf-c-box` | Removes padding on the box so that the contents extend to the edge of the box. The box's child elements will be padded to ensure proper spacing to the outside of the box. ** Note: ** All direct children of a full bleed box should be block-level elements. |
