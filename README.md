# PatternFly Next

## Install

- This assumes an environment is already set up for npm packages - if not, please use npm init following the steps at [https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-a-package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-a-package.json).
- run `npm install @patternfly/patternfly-next --save`

When you install PatternFly Next, the package includes:

- a single file for the entire compiled library: `node_modules/@patternfly/patternfly-next/dist/patternfly.css`
- individual files with each component compiled separately: `node_modules/@patternfly/patternfly-next/dist/<ComponentName>/styles.css`
- a single file for the entire library's source (SASS): `node_modules/@patternfly/patternfly-next/dist/patternfly.scss`
- individual files for each component's source (SASS): `node_modules/@patternfly/patternfly-next/dist/<ComponentName>/styles.scss`

Any of the files above are meant for use in consuming the library. The recommended
consumption approach will vary from project to project.
