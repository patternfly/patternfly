# PatternFly RC2.1 (2019-06-11)
- @patternfly/patternfly@2.12.5

**Components:**
*   **About Modal Box:** addressed overflow of about modal [(#1902)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-next/pull/1902)
*   **Accordion:** removed need for class on toggle icon ([#1889](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-next/pull/1889))

*   **Datalist:** added breakpoints for actions ([#1886](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-next/pull/1886))
*   **Inline alert:** We had previously applied `font-size` to the inline alerts via `.pf-c-alert__icon > i`, which didnâ€™t work in React since the icon is an svg. We applied `font-size` to `.pf-c-alert__icon` instead. Also, the inline warning icon was fixed because it was wider than the others ([#1909](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-next/pull/1909))
*   **Notification Badge:** added notification badge ([#1862](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-next/pull/1862))

*   **Table:**
    *   media query now matches border. Fixed the table so that when the table breaks to grid form, the border width changes to 8px, and the border color matches the background color. ([#1881](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-next/pull/1881))
    *   added an extra breakpoint [(#1880](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-next/pull/1880))

**Docs:**
*   **App launcher:**  consistency in documentation ([#1873](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-next/pull/1873))
*   **Card:** updated action order in img/action examples, rename demo ([#1898](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-next/pull/1898))
*   **A11y:** fixed a few accessibility errors ([#1905](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-next/pull/1905/files))
*   **Layout:** updated docs [(#1885](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-next/pull/1885))
